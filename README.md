## Criteria
- The user must must run "npm install", then enter "node index.js" in terminal to begin the Team Profile application.
- The user will need to have the relevant employee information.
## Usage/coding:
- This JS application was written to allow for a clean user experience. The general logic is as follows:
   - Once the initial criteria above is met, the user will respond to a series of prompts.
   - The prompts will populate a Template Literal in the form of a user friendly Team Profile webpage.
   - Blank responses will not effect the functionality. 
   - User respones will be used in various ways; some stand alone, while others concatenate to predefined text in the Template Literal. 
   - The user can enter as many, or as few, employees as they would like.
